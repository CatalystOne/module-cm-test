Note - This is a template for standardized README.md file which will help teams to start somewhere with document first approach. You have to replace the content according to your project needs. (Delete this note as well)

*TIP - main point is to try to have the README.md being the "market place" for the library (why other projects should choose to use it), with a full set of statuses of the current codebase, links to CI with details of latest build(s)*
