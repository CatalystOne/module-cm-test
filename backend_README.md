# Name of code-base/repository/project
{A brief introduction the code-base/repository/project}



Note - This is a template for standardized README.md file which will help teams to start somewhere with document first approach. You have to replace the content according to your project needs. (Delete this note as well)

*TIP1 main point is to try to have the README.md being the "market place" for the code-base, with a full set of statuses of the current codebase, links to CI with details of latest build(s), links to its running status (version, uptime++ in various dev/test environments...*

*TIP2  -  one use-case you may have in mind to guide is...   a developer is awoke at 0300 to fix a critical issue blocking the platform in production...   he/she is dead tired and has never seen the code-base before...  how to make sure that he/she fast get a correct understanding of the situation, and to help him/her to fix the problem and release a patch to production as fast as possible  (i.e.  if production is running 1.2.5  and the current version of the code-base is 1.7.6 - the consequences for the result may be critical if a 1.7.6 patch is released versus a 1.2.7 patch..)*

qa - add URL of the service health endpint to show deployed version and uptime
..opstest, pre-qa, demo, prod
```


## Live URLs
```
devtest - add URL of the service UI for quick visit  (auth info/hints)

```


## API

java -jar target/...
```
## Contribution
